# LGT Platform Architecture

LGT (LG Telecom) is a WIPI-based mobile platform. Currently only **Clet** (C native apps) execution is implemented. Java app support is not yet implemented.

## App Structure

An LGT app consists of:
- A JAR containing:
  - `binary.mod` — an ARM ELF executable
  - App resources
- An `app_info` file (separate from the JAR) — app descriptor (AID, PID, MClass)

### Clets

C native apps compiled as standard ARM ELF binaries. Unlike KTF's raw binary format, LGT uses proper ELF with section headers, allowing standard loading at specified addresses.

### Java Apps

Not yet implemented.

## Platform Interfaces

LGT uses an **import table** mechanism instead of KTF's direct callback approach.

### Import Table System

During initialization, the native binary receives platform callbacks for import resolution:
- one callback identifies an import table
- another resolves a function pointer from a table ID and function index

The binary uses these callbacks to resolve each platform function it needs. Known tables:

| Table ID | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `0x1fb`  | WIPI C functions (kernel, graphics, etc.) |
| `0x64`   | Java interface functions |
| `0x1`    | C standard library (memcpy, strlen, etc.) |

### WIPI C Interface

Same API surface as KTF (kernel, graphics, database, timer, etc.), but delivered through the import table rather than a named interface pointer.

### Standard Library

LGT-specific: provides C standard library functions (memcpy, strlen, etc.) that the native binary expects from the platform. KTF binaries include these in their own binary; LGT imports them.

## Initialization Sequence

1. Platform parses `binary.mod` as ELF, loads sections into memory at their specified addresses
2. Calls the ELF entrypoint with platform-owned initialization blocks
   - one of these blocks contains the import-resolution callbacks
3. The binary stores the import-resolution callbacks and uses them on demand when platform functions are needed
4. The binary returns a pointer to a structure containing its initialization entry
5. Platform calls that initialization entry to start the app

## Key Differences from KTF

| Aspect | KTF | LGT |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Binary format | Raw ARM (`client.bin`) | ELF (`binary.mod`) |
| Function binding | Direct callback pointers | Import table lookup |
| Java integration | AOT-compiled into ARM binary | Not yet implemented |
| C stdlib | Included in binary | Provided by platform |

## How We Emulate This

- **ARM execution**: Same `wie_core_arm::ArmCore` as KTF.
- **ELF loading**: Uses the `elf` crate to parse sections and load them at their specified addresses.
- **Import table**: Rust callbacks map `(table_id, function_index)` pairs to registered function addresses for WIPI C, Java interface, and stdlib functions.
- **JVM**: Uses `RustJavaJvmImplementation` (pure Rust JVM) since there's no AOT-compiled Java to run from ARM memory.
